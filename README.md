# FIFA Ultimate Team Manager

## Project Proposal

The **FIFA Ultimate Team Manager** application allows users to create and manage a collection of 23 players, adhering to the standard FIFA Ultimate Team roster of 11 starters and 12 substitutes. Each player profile includes detailed information such as *name*, *nationality*, *rating*, *position*, and specific stats like *pace*, *passing*, *shooting*, *weak foot*, and *club affiliation*. Users can assign a *price* to each player, enabling the program to **calculate the total price** of the team based on individual player costs.

Additionally, the application offers a search functionality where users can input their **budget**, specify **desired players**, and set criteria for **team rating** and **chemistry**. The program then filters and displays teams that match these preferences, ensuring that users can find a reliable and optimized team without the need for extensive experimentation.

Furthermore, the application includes a **popularity feature** where users can **like** their favorite team builds. This allows users to **compare teams based on how popular they are**, showcasing the most liked and highly rated team configurations within the community. This feature is especially beneficial for new FIFA players who want to build a competitive team quickly and efficiently without incurring unnecessary transfer fees or risking poor team performance.

  - **Total Chemistry:** Sum of chemistry points for all players.

**Who will use it?**
- **FIFA Ultimate Team Players:** Ideal for those who prefer a *tried-and-tested* team setup without the hassle of manually mixing and matching players.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
- As a **gaming and football enthusiast**, I have a passion for FIFA. Each year, when the game is released, players seek reliable starter teams or aim to experiment with new player combinations. Manually adjusting teams can lead to high transfer fees, potential losses due to poor team performance, and wasted time. **FIFA Ultimate Team Manager** simplifies this process by providing optimized team suggestions based on user-defined budgets and preferences, saving both time and resources. The added popularity feature allows users to identify and adopt the most favored team builds within the community, further enhancing their gaming experience.
